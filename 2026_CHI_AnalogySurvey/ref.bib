    abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach, referred to as the WordTree design-by-analogy method, for identifying distant-domain analogies as part of the ideation process. The WordTree method derives its effectiveness through a design team’s knowledge and readily available information sources (e.g., patent databases, Google) and does not require specialized computational knowledge bases. A controlled cognitive experiment and an evaluation of the method with redesign projects illustrate the method’s influence in assisting engineers in design-by-analogy. Individuals using the WordTree method identified significantly more analogies and searched outside the problem domain as compared to the control group. The team redesign projects demonstrate the WordTree method’s effectiveness in longer-term, more realistic, higher validity team projects and with a variety of different design problems. Teams successfully identified effective analogies, analogous domains, and analogous patents. Unexpected and unique solutions are identified using the method. For example, one of the teams identified a dump truck and panning for gold as effective analogies for the design of a self-cleaning cat litter box. In the controlled experiment, a cherry pitter was identified and implemented as a solution for designing a machine to shell peanuts. The experimental results also highlight potential improvements for the method and areas for future research in engineering design theory.},

abstract = {This paper examines prevailing understandings of creativity in creative computing research through the lens of feminist epistemology. We analyze “creativity support” as a construct that encodes different definitions of creative work. Drawing on existing literature and practices, the paper surfaces four views about creative work that underpin current creative technologies and HCI research: problem-solving, cognitive emergence, embodied action, and tool-mediated expert activity. Each view makes different claims about the role of computing in creative work and the creative subject assumed. We articulate the attendant politics of each view and illustrate how critical feminist epistemology can serve as an analytical tool to reason about the trade-offs of various creativity definitions. The paper concludes with recommendations for integrating feminist values into creativity-oriented HCI research.},

abstract = {We present BioSpark, a system for analogical innovation designed to act as a creativity partner in reducing the cognitive effort in finding, mapping, and creatively adapting diverse inspirations. While prior approaches have focused on initial stages of finding inspirations, BioSpark uses LLMs embedded in a familiar, visual, Pinterest-like interface to go beyond inspiration to supporting users in identifying the key solution mechanisms, transferring them to the problem domain, considering tradeoffs, and elaborating on details and characteristics. To accomplish this BioSpark introduces several novel contributions, including a tree-of-life enabled approach for generating relevant and diverse inspirations, as well as AI-powered cards including ‘Sparks’ for analogical transfer; ‘Trade-offs’ for considering pros and cons; and ‘Q&A’ for deeper elaboration. We evaluated BioSpark through workshops with professional designers and a controlled user study, finding that using BioSpark led to a greater number of generated ideas; those ideas being rated higher in creative quality; and more diversity in terms of biological inspirations used than a control condition. Our results suggest new avenues for creativity support tools embedding AI in familiar interaction paradigms for designer workflows.},

abstract = {Teaching scientific concepts is essential but challenging, and analogies help students connect new concepts to familiar ideas. Advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable generating analogies, yet their effectiveness in education remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conducted a two-stage study involving high school students and teachers to assess the effectiveness of LLM-generated analogies in biology and physics through a controlled in-class test and a classroom field study. Test results suggested that LLM-generated analogies could enhance student understanding particularly in biology, but require teachers’ guidance to prevent over-reliance and overconfidence. Classroom experiments suggested that teachers could refine LLM-generated analogies to their satisfaction and inspire new analogies from generated ones, encouraged by positive classroom feedback and homework performance boosts. Based on findings, we developed and evaluated a practical system to help teachers generate and refine teaching analogies. We discussed future directions for developing and evaluating LLM-supported teaching and learning by analogy.},

abstract = {The importance of empathy cannot be overstated in modern societies where people of diverse backgrounds increasingly interact together. The HCI community has strived to foster affective empathy through immersive technologies. Many previous techniques are built upon a premise that presenting the same experience as-is may help evoke the same emotion, which however faces limitations in matters where the emotional responses largely differ across individuals. In this paper, we present a novel concept of generating a personalized experience based on a large language model (LLM) to facilitate affective empathy between individuals despite their differences. As a case study to showcase its effectiveness, we developed EmoSync, an LLM-based agent that generates personalized analogical microaggression situations, facilitating users to personally resonate with a specific microaggression situation of another person. EmoSync is designed and evaluated along a 3-phased user study with 100+ participants. We comprehensively discuss implications, limitations, and possible applications.Disclaimer: Readers may find content of a discriminative or stereotypical nature, which is inevitable given this work’s theme.},

abstract = {Bio-inspired design (BID) fosters innovations in engineering. Learning BID is crucial for developing multidisciplinary innovation skills of designers and engineers. Current BID education aims to enhance learners’ understanding and analogical reasoning skills. However, it often heavily relies on the teachers’ expertise. When learners pursue independent learning using some educational tools, they face challenges in understanding and reasoning practice within this multidisciplinary field. Additionally, evaluating their learning outcomes comprehensively becomes problematic. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a LLMs-driven BID education method based on a structured ontology and three strategies: enhancing understanding through LLMs-enpowered "learning by asking", assisting reasoning by providing hints and feedback, and assessing learning outcomes through benchmarking against existing BID cases. Implementing the method, we developed BIDTrainer, a BID education tool. User studies indicate that learners using BIDTrainer understood BID knowledge better, reason faster with higher interactivity than the baseline, and BIDTrainer assessed the learning outcomes consistent with experts.},

abstract = {With recent advancements in the capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) AI models, product designers have begun experimenting with them in their work. However, T2I models struggle to interpret abstract language and the current user experience of T2I tools can induce design fixation rather than a more iterative, exploratory process. To address these challenges, we developed Inkspire, a sketch-driven tool that supports designers in prototyping product design concepts with analogical inspirations and a complete sketch-to-design-to-sketch feedback loop. To inform the design of Inkspire, we conducted an exchange session with designers and distilled design goals for improving T2I interactions. In a within-subjects study comparing Inkspire to ControlNet, we found that Inkspire supported designers with more inspiration and exploration of design ideas, and improved aspects of the co-creative process by allowing designers to effectively grasp the current state of the AI to guide it towards novel design intentions.},
